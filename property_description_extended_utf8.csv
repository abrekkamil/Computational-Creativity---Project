The homes are the result of five years of design development and are being built around three main pillars: to be carbon negative, with zero construction waste and net energy positive and so set to incur no utility bills. The homes are fully electric, powered solely by solar panels and are all EPC A rated. The majority of the features in the homes have been designed bespoke for The Arbour and include compressed earth brick walls and lampshades made from site soil, worktops made from wood shavings from the timber frame, shower panels from recycled plastics and more.IF YOU LIVED HERE The interior design is by Rockett St George, who have carefully curated each space and fixture to align with the aspirations of the project, which debuts their new sustainable furniture range. Materials have been selected portray a contemporary design, to be low carbon and require little maintenance. The Arbour benefits from an abundance of communal landscaped spaces, including a central community garden that will include vegetable patches, foraging, outdoor kitchen and seating. The gardens have been landscaped by the award-winning London Glades, to be self-sustainable over time and to provide a safe and enjoyable space for families to come together. The development also includes a re-use centre, an electric car club vehicle and electric and traditional bicycles all exclusively reserved for residents. WHAT ELSE?- Walthamstow schools are excellent and plentiful, within a one mile radius alone you have twenty eight primary/secondary schools, all rated 'Good' or better by Ofsted with eight deemed 'Outstanding'.- Your spoilt for choice when it comes to great pubs. The Queen's Arms is the closest, offering excellent food and a great choice of craft beers in a comfortable , traditionally sumptuous environment. - Amongst many other local highlights, Europe's longest street market runs down Walthamstow High Street, less than a half mile stroll away as well as Epping Forest and the Walthamstow Wetlands.While the perks of Walthamstow Village are a mere stone’s throw away, you’ll have your own community on your literal doorstep;....... Residents can ‘live, work and play’ within the space, with access to a covered community garden with an outdoor workstation and kitchen for preparing homegrown food, as well as a reuse centre for exchanging goods between residents.'For me, this development is watershed moment in British construction. The building techniques used have been groundbreaking and once I delved into the details, I was left inspired by the materials used and conscious of how our consumer choices can make a difference.  The project has been carefully curated over 5 years and studies embarked on by GS8 have unearthed issues associated with standard building techniques. With innovative ideas the GS8 team have set about to find solutions to assist this project and help move the industry forward, which in turn will benefit future generations. Purchasers have a rare chance to own a home that in years to come will be recognised as a masterpiece in construction, which challenges not only the way we build but also the way with live.'

This pretty cherry blossom-lined road was Walthamstow’s original high street and continues to be a mix of commercial & residential properties, within a key area in the gentrification of Walthamstow.Extended over most of the plot with a small garden area at the rear, this is no ordinary refurb. The owners have run a successful business here since the 1970s, having always loved the village location. So when they decided to modernise they engaged specialist architects to design and extend the space to a contemporary finish, while preserving  the building’s historic character and attributes. And the result is gorgeous.It’s set over 2 floors, with a reception area at the front, open-plan desk space, storage space, kitchen area, 2 WCs with disabled access & shower room, and a new staircase leading up to meeting rooms.The pitched roof & exposed ceiling joists not only look incredible, they maximise the sense of space; and a glass divide over the party wall provides sound proofing, without compromising the flow of natural light. People love working here because of its homely atmosphere & village location. And the refurb reflects what people want in offices now. The state of the art ventilation system physically changes the air & a fully equipped kitchen gives people the means to make a good meal at lunchtime, with a comfortable space to sit or step outside.Located in the heart of the village, & a short walk from local cafes, restaurants and sports facilities, there’s easy access to transport links by bus, by tube and Overground from Walthamstow Central station, which is a 10 minute walk away or a 4 minute cycle. This is the perfect setup for a modern business, a piece of history in east London, and an architectural labour of love which also has the potential to be converted back into a residential dwelling.Ground Floor - Entrance - Via front door leading directly into:Office Space One - 13.84m x 3.30m (45'5 x 10'10) - Staircase leading to first floor.

You're really close to Peckham Rye Park and Common's 113 acres, the beautiful green space of Nunhead cemetery, and also to volunteer-run Aquarius Golf Club. Your local stations are Nunhead, Peckham Rye and Brockley; all are circa a mile from the house (and Fare Zone 2).  From the hall, your formal through-reception rests to your left. Beautifully-laid oak herringbone flooring runs through here - reclaimed from a school in north Wales. Further treats include cast iron radiators, a gas-fuelled stove in woodburner style, and an original fireplace reinstated (not functional); both with slate hearths. The large kitchen/dining room - of over 18 feet by over 11 feet - is accessed from part-glazed timber double-doors (yet another lovely feature). What a room! Marrying old and new harmoniously, you've got a large roof light over the dining area, and a dreamy fitted kitchen from British Standard by Plain English, teamed with Carrera marble and reclaimed Iroko hardwood worktops. Other welcome features include a fitted larder, a boiler cupboard, storage, laundry space for washer/dryer, and a polished concrete floor (with clever water underfloor heating system). At the foot of the delightful room, you have a full-span, narrow-frame sliding glazing system, which fully opens for inside-out dining in the summer months.  Up to the first floor and from the half-landing, you'll find the main bathroom (which was renovated in 2019) to the rear of the house, with sash window, neat and modern white suite, and large built-in cupboard - which is great for towels and such.  From the main landing, find a large and twin-sashed master bedroom across the front of the house (this is over 12 feet by over 11 feet), and your second bedroom's next door (of over 11 feet by over 7 feet). Both rooms have original feature fireplaces, and wool carpets were laid in 2020 (sanded and treated floorboards with 'white wash' are beneath the carpets - if that's more your thing). At the top of the house is a very lovely large loft bedroom, of over 19 feet by over 12 feet. You have Velux and casement windows, and custom-built wardrobes plus accessible eaves storage. A neat and windowed en suite with large walk-in shower completes the house tour.  Green space? Peckham Rye Park & Common is your most local green space (walk five minutes) - comprising a Victorian Park and historic common; a pleasant refuge for both the local community and wildlife. It's home to ornamental gardens, streams, woodland and a lake, playgrounds and a cafe, plus outdoor gym. The park has been awarded Green Flag status and has a long, rich and engaging history - it was recorded as being cultivated before the Norman Conquest in the 11th Century! At the tip of the common you have a host of cool eateries like Mr Bao, Good Neighbour and Banh Banh, and trendy hairdressing salon (Blue Tit).  Bellenden Road, Blenheim Grove and Rye Lane are also close for yummy restaurants (we love Levan, Ganapati, The Begging Bowl and Artusi), cool bars and pubs, Peckham Levels, and The Bussey Building.  You're a short stroll from Nunhead and East Dulwich's town centres too. In Nunhead we like Kudu Grill and El Vermut, plus Ayres bakery and FC Soper wet fish shop. Brockley's also close for more options, and for pubs - The Ivy House, The Waverley, The Herne and The Angel Oak are all strong locals.  Local schools are all good; your most local is Ivydale Primary."

186,https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/121504370#/?channel=RES_BUY,"The AreaForest Gate has a history of offering a mosaic of woodland and grazing (it's in the name!), forming part of Wanstead Flats and wider Epping Forest. Not many know about this hidden green oasis in the far reaches of the East End. This one-of-a-kind home was recently completed on a plot in the heart of Forest Gate. Finding a plot of land of this size and potential in London is becoming an increasing rarity, but for Mr C who designed and developed the property, it was an opportunity not to miss. The site was just a post-war gap between houses, left to the elements for too long.  Planning was achieved for a 3-bedroom house on the site, with a split lower and upper-level layout, creating almost a hidden home in residential Newham.Architecture and property'The internal face of the house is all clad in waterproofed cork sheets, perfect for retaining heat and acoustics. It also has a subtle wood bark smell, which defined our relationship with the house', Mr C explains as he walks me through the process of build & eventual design. The soil was of solid clay ground when preparing the site, thus foundation works were smooth, great for the lower floor's concrete 'basin'.  Pink-hued facing bricks are used for the exterior, alongside low-carbon blockwork to form cavity walls, where exposed Douglas Fir roof joists sit on and form the flat green roofs. Mr C explains how they had to use a 'contrasting' material for the taller volume of the roof, so went for corrugated metal sheets to clad the upper level of the house. The house is surrounded by gardens on all sides, which ensures that all the courtyards are visually and physically connected. Skylights are consciously positioned throughout for daylight to stream into the house. Natural materials are used throughout to give a harmony to the aesthetic, with cork sheets lining the cavity walls, treated plywood panels used to line the ceiling and breathable lime render on all internal partitions. The floor is finished with poured resin over underfloor heating; a wonderful treat for barefoot living. Brass kitchen cabinetry is used to bring drama and to reflect light in the centre of the house, a bold statement for a home with otherwise organic finishes. BackgroundMr C talked to me about how he wanted to build beautiful sustainability into the house, which is why they opted for cork sheets.  This sustainable awareness is echoed in the low-carbon blockwork and lime render. The house achieves a blend of being visually attractive whilst retaining the all-important sustainability creds. The level of thoughtfulness brought to the materials throughout the house also delivers cheaper energy bills!As an architect, Mr C has always wanted to build his own house and came across the plot online by chance. Having been living in North London, with no prior connection to Forest Gate, he and his partner suddenly realised what could be achieved, in this exciting location.  In order to achieve planning requirements, the house could not be too tall, so they opted for a half-sunken lower-ground floor level for the principal bedroom and ensuite bathroom. This resulted in a shorter flight of stairs with no landing to reduce the flow around levels, consequently opening up an additional room in the stairwell itself. The windows in the central courtyard also connect the level visually from room to room.As the internal face of the house is cork clad, this keeps heat in and provides additional natural insulation and a textured approach, creating an almost cocoon-like feel to the house.Out and AboutAs this is a genuine East End residential area, it has an obvious energy for regeneration given its proximity to the Elizabeth Line. This area has become increasingly popular with young families, benefitting from a great school network and rapid access to City, Stansted and Luton airports. Close by are Forest Gate Arches, recently regenerated to include an array of great local businesses. Some choice pickings include, Wild Goose Bakery, an artisan bakery, an authentic Italian delicatessen and Pretty Decent Beer Company, an independent brewery just at the end of the road!  The Holly Tree pub just around the corner has been refurbished and is perfect for a Sunday roast.Hackney Wick and Stratford are close by as well, with a vast array of pubs, bars and restaurants, and the Westfield shopping centre is a short drive. A real asset is the proximity to the huge natural areas of Wanstead Flats, and the close proximity to Epping Forest. ""Whenever we want to take a break from working at home, we go for a walk in the Flats trying out different paths. It is massive, full of ponds and lakes teeming with nature. Wellies are a must though "" said Mr C. Transport LinksForest Gate overground is a 9 minute walk, connecting straight through to Liverpool Street for the City, and linking up with Stratford for the Central Line. Wanstead Park overground is also a 7 minute stroll, linking West to East, and is only two stops to Barking for the district line. An array of 24-hour buses from Forest Road take you straight into Stratford Westfield and the Olympic in under 30 minutes."

And if you’re meeting friends, then where better than to head into Walthamstow Village, where there are more bars and eateries than you can shake a stick at, and up to Ravenswood, where the neon is always glowing at God’s Own Junkyard and is home to several breweries where you can sit and drink outside.  The house is right by Hoe St with exceptional pizza at Yard Sale and SoDo and also in proximity to the St James St area with all the culinary experiences at Crate.  If it all gets a get too much, the house is also within a stone’s throw of Thomas Gamuel Park (if you have any canine or feline members of the family they are going to love this house too!), so just relax on a bench in the park and watch the world go by…!In The Owners Words... - “We’ve loved living in this beautiful home in this little pocket of Walthamstow.  Just a 10 minute walk to the Village, with close access to both the Hoe St and St James St areas it's right in the middle of things.  It also only takes 8 minutes to walk the tube, which provides a fantastic balance of life in London.  We enjoy just being in the house: both the bright, open, spacious feeling of the extension and the snuggly hygge vibes in the living room and bedrooms.  Then also the garden with barbecues on the patio, lying out on the grass and gardening, eating, reading or doing yoga out on the decking.  We've also been blessed with a friendly neighbourhood, which has a real community spirit.  We love walking up to the Village with great food at Eat 17, getting the best fish n chips on Orford Rd, and all the other options for eating out; then up to God’s Own Junkyard and all the breweries for a night out, and so many great pizza places with Yard Sale, So Do (Hoe St), and The Italian Bakery (St James St).  Due to the many transport links the whole of London feels at your fingertips.  We regularly swim at Parliament Hill Lido and walk on Hampstead Heath and door to door it only takes 25 minutes from Walthamstow Queens Rd (a huge bonus because of our position in the area).  We enjoy running up to and around Hollow Ponds, the mysterious park where Alfred Hitchcock grew up and also Wanstead Park with it’s lake and grotto, only 10 minutes drive away.""Dimensions: - Entrance - Via front door leading into:Entrance Hallway - Staircase leading to first floor.

The large rear garden is well screened by mature trees, being utilised by both parts of the property. There is space to park 2 cars to the front with the potential to create more parking subject to the usual consents being obtained.

We fell in love with it the minute we viewed, with the size of the rooms, high ceilings and general character. Its versatility has worked so well over the years, enabling family and friends to stay over within their own space. We love that the garden offers all day sunshine, seclusion and an array of wildlife. It's a lovely area to live in with a great community spirit. We will be sad to leave and shall certainly miss living here, but in our later years we are now in need of a property that better suits our needs."

There is clear potential to extend the characterful property - either up in the loft (which currently offers lots of storage space), over the side return, or both!  The location's a desirable residential street which is close to central Camberwell and Peckham too - walk just 10 minutes to Denmark Hill Station, and 14 to Peckham Rye Station. Permit-parking is on-street.  The house has been carefully renovated and improved over the current owner's long occupancy, delivering many welcome features, including stripped floors, period fireplaces and custom-made storage.  A walled front garden fronts the house. In the front door and your wooden-floored double-reception rests to your left. This extends over 22 feet. The front sash window has plantation shutters, which offer privacy (and look great as well!). There's built-in storage to one alcove and a delightful period fireplace. The second reception space has pro-papered walls, and glazed double doors which open out to the side-return area of the garden.  Back to the hall and past the handy under stairs cupboard and you'll find the double-aspect kitchen/dining room, with a practical tiled floor, and which stretches over 21 feet. The timeless fitted kitchen leads to a natural dining space - with delightful garden views and a sunny orientation. Designer wallpaper again features, plus a back door out to the garden.  The easy and established garden has been professionally landscaped and has a handy little outhouse off the back of the house.  Up to the half-landing and you'll find a large and double-aspect full bathroom, with both bath and independent walk-in shower. Built-in storage further impresses, as does a stylish heated towel rail. A couple of welcome storage cupboards (one a large boiler room; the other a slim cupboard) are found on the half-landing outside the bathroom.  From the landing proper, you have your first double bedroom, of over 10 feet by over 9 feet, with a cute original feature fireplace.  Finally, find the master bedroom to the front of the house. Twin sash windows provide leafy park vistas over Lucas Gardens. What a treat in Zone 2! Generous built-in closets, another fireplace and alcove storage tick more boxes.  St. Giles Church and Churchyard are utterly lovely local landmarks, and you're also close to South London Gallery, plus Camberwell's iconic art college buildings. It's a very nice part of town. Beyond Lucas Gardens, you've got lots of other green spaces around and about - Brunswick, Ruskin and Burgess Parks for example, and Lettsom and Warwick Gardens too. Peckham Rye Park and Common and Brockwell Park and Lido aren't far either.  Local schools include Lyndhurst Primary and The Villa Nursery and Pre-Prep. School.  Restaurants, cafes, pubs and bars are strong and varied round this way. We particularly like The Camberwell Arms (more than a pub - the restaurant offering is delicious), Grove House Tavern, The Crooked Well, Silk Road and Theo's. Walk to Peckham's Bellenden Road and Rye Lane for other excellent offerings - including Artusi, Ganapati, Levan, Peckham Levels and The Bussey Building, plus handy high street shops, pop-ups and markets.  Butterfly Tennis Club and Zen Yoga studio are also nearby, on Camberwell Grove, as well as the Victorian leisure centre with big pool, gym and classes. You are close to two Fare Zone 2 stations as previously mentioned, and also to a host of day and night bus routes at the foot of the street, from Camberwell Church Street. For more options, Peckham, Herne Hill, Dulwich Village, East Dulwich, Brixton and New Cross are all easily reached.

Parking is unrestricted on the street. Freehold.  Find the handsome home on a quiet, tree-lined residential street in Nunhead, close to Nunhead's high street and Nunhead Green Conservation Area. You're also close to all things Peckham.  Station-wise... you have Queens Road Peckham, Nunhead and Peckham Rye all within easy walking distance (walk eight, nine and 12 minutes respectively). All are Fare Zone 2.  A neat front garden graces the front of the house. You open directly into an opened-up double reception room of over 22 feet by over 15 feet. Wooden floors and alcove storage, plus plantation shutters to lower window panes (in the front reception space) all impress. There's an under stairs cupboard for coats and such, and next to this you open into the generous double-aspect kitchen/diner - which runs over 22 feet with a fully-tiled floor. The fitted kitchen is a modern style with plenty of units and worktop space.  Access the garden via a back door here (extension potential alert), onto a paved area - ideal for al fresco meals - which leads to a generous lawn. Beyond is a raised deck with shed (which is staying).  Up the stairs and from the half-landing, find your windowed bathroom and separate w.c. (modern white sanitary ware in both) to your left, and at the rear of the house is your first double bedroom, of 8 feet by over 8. Garden vistas are enjoyed from the window here.  From the main landing, you've got your second bedroom on your left - of over 10 feet by over 9 feet, and a delightful master bedroom of over 15 feet by nearly 11 feet - with built-in closets running one entire wall, two double-glazed windows, and a dark green hue to the walls.  What's local? Central Nunhead has excellent independent staples: Ayre's bakery and FC Soper wet fish shop, for example. Strong establishments to eat include Four Hundred Rabbits, The Old Nun's Head and Kudu Grill (all are on Nunhead Lane itself). And Peckham Bazaar on nearby Consort Road is close for pan-Balkan cuisine and a wonderful wine list.  The Bussey Building & Copeland Park complex, plus Peckham Levels and Market Building are also just a short walk from your door - for the trendiest of eateries, drinkeries, plays, exhibitions and the like (don't miss the rooftop bars in the warm months). We like Tonkotsu for Ramen, and Forza Wine particularly. The triangle at the end of Peckham Rye Park and Common's 113 acres is also awash with places to eat, drink and hang out; Good Neighbour, Mr Bao, Banh Banh and Voodoo Ray's being a handful. Bellenden Road, Choumert Road, Blenheim Grove and Rye Lane dish up more food and drink options; we especially like Miss Tapas, Artusi, Levan, Il Giardino, The Begging Bowl and Ganapati. Camberwell, New Cross and Deptford are also no great distance by bus, cycle or foot.  Kids or thinking of? Local schools include Edmund Waller, Ivydale, Oakdale, Rye Oak and St Mary Magdalene C of E primaries. Banana Moon Day Nursery on Machell Road is also close."

This is so much more than just another new housing scheme. Every aspect of the design and architecture has been a collaboration between designer Matthias Felsch and sculptor Jeff Lowe. It represents their belief that new homes absolutely can combine style, functionality, and individuality. Jeff was keen to ensure that the houses all had dedicated creative spaces, while Matthias saw to it that, whilst there is an extraordinary amount of floor space on offer, each one is a practical home as well. Number 3 is one of three town houses and is slightly larger at 150 square metres. As with number 2, accommodation is arranged over three spacious levels but the twist lies in its outdoor space. Rather than a top floor terrace, this house has a walled rear garden which becomes an extension of the large living area once those oversized bi-fold doors are thrown open.On the first floor you will find two double bedrooms and two bathrooms; the minimal, clean lines balance well with the natural tones Matthias has used. Spanning the top floor is a cavernous studio with high, beamed ceilings whose cool limed finish create a gently industrial feel. As will the other houses in the mews, this space lends itself to all sorts of activities: a gym, further reception space, vast bedroom or a studio/office that would hold a serious-sized business.The focus of the design is very much the consolidation of home and work. the integral tech is thoroughly up to date, with Cat 6 cabling and local fibre broadband should you want it, while clever internal lighting options give total control over your environment.This quiet corner of South East London is something of a hidden gem. It is a desirable residential location but with Hither Green Station more or less on the door step, it is a gateway to London and beyond. Trains to London Bridge, Charing Cross or Cannon Street are frequent and take around ten minutes. There is also the option for a change at New Cross for the Overground to Shoreditch and North London or head to Lewisham and grab the DLR for Canary Wharf, Stratford, or The City.Lewisham's constantly evolving town centre is close by. You can take a train or bus there, but it is an easy walk. There is lots on offer here in terms of shopping and eateries but, closer to home and on either side of the tracks, there is an equally impressive selection of coffee houses and places to eat and drink. Found Hope Store on Hither Green Lane offers some fine artisan fare, coffee, and wine. You could also take cocktails at, Bobs just a few doors down. On the other side of the railway you can enjoy the food, drink, and atmosphere at the Station Hotel - something of a local landmark these days. It sits in what feels like an urban village, very quiet and also close to the green spaces at Mountsfield Park, Manor park & Manor House Gardens."

Peckham Rye Park & Common is your most local green space (walk five minutes) - comprising a Victorian Park and historic common; a pleasant refuge for both the local community and wildlife. It's home to ornamental gardens, streams, woodland and a lake, playgrounds and a cafe, plus outdoor gym. The park has been awarded Green Flag status and has a long, rich and engaging history - it was recorded as being cultivated before the Norman Conquest in the 11th Century! At the tip of the common you have a host of cool eateries and such - including Mr Bao, Good Neighbour and Banh Banh, and trendy hairdressing salon (Blue Tit).  Bellenden Road, Blenheim Grove and Rye Lane are also close for yummy restaurants (we love Levan, Ganapati, The Begging Bowl and Artusi), cool bars and pubs, Peckham Levels, and The Bussey Building.  You're a short stroll from Nunhead and East Dulwich's town centres too. In Nunhead we like Kudu Grill and El Vermut, plus Ayres bakery and FC Soper wet fish shop. Brockley's also close for more options, and for pubs - The Ivy House, The Waverley, The Herne and The Angel Oak are all strong locals.  Local schools are good; your most local is Ivydale Primary."

They combine to create a near-perfect, modern family home. Sumptuous and draped in colour, the ground floor is a dream to entertain in. The cosy and atmospheric bay-fronted living room connects with the luminous light-filled kitchen/diner extension with doors opening onto the garden oasis, complete with its own wood cabin. The considered design means each 'zone' feels self-contained yet provides a lovely, inter-connected flow.  Upstairs, the thoughtful layout continues. There are two large double bedrooms, an exquisitely designed bathroom with a soaking tub on the first floor, and a further two bedrooms, one en-suite, in the loft extension. Currently set up as a dressing room, the fourth bedroom would work equally well as a dedicated home office. Perched on the outskirts of the city, Bounds Green profits from lush parkland in all directions, a vibrant neighbourhood and excellent transport connections, whisking you to Central London in around 20 minutes. For all these reasons and more, it's easy to understand why this pocket of London is such a draw for families, young and old.The Owners Say - We adore this beautiful home that we have so lovingly created and will absolutely miss everything the area has to offer. We are incredibly lucky to be a short walk away from both underground (Piccadilly Line) and overground (Great Northern Rail). We have an abundance of green spaces close by and are in the catchment for an outstanding primary school which is quite literally at the end of the road. Our local pub, The Ranelagh, is excellent, as are the local friendly coffee shops such as White Fig and dog-friendly Hot Milk. The Organic store near Bounds Green Tube is very well stocked, and the rather splendid Myddleton Road market is where you can pick up everything from Artisan bakes to vintage finds. We're incredibly lucky to have wonderful neighbours all along the street. From coffee mornings to festive drinks, the Stanley Road community spirit runs deep. We have had some wonderful, memorable, happy years living here and shall greatly miss it.Points To Consider - The EPC gives a current Energy Efficiency Rating: C and a potential Energy Efficiency Rating: BIn the Borough of Enfield, the house falls into Council Tax Band D (£1,841.71 in 2022).The current owners have entirely updated the house. Large ticket items include a loft extension, creating two new bedrooms, and an ensuite- bathroom. The new principal bedroom on the top floor has many thoughtful touches, including rimless plastered-in recessed spotlights and 'hidden' storage. Downstairs, they built an open plan kitchen/diner extension with polished concrete floors and underfloor heating, plus a new WC and utility room. All the bathrooms have underfloor heating. Furthermore, they have replaced the boiler and added new windows throughout, including Velux windows in the loft bedroom. Outside, they've landscaped the front and back gardens and retiled the front path. In short, the house is being handed over in impeccable condition inside and out. Current monthly utility costs run at gas £56, electricity £70 and water £26.The house is being sold chain free.About Brickworks - Brickworks is an independent company committed to an intelligent and ethical approach to estate agency.

904,https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/122120573#/?channel=RES_BUY,"Top 3 things you love about your home1. The overall space available in the property.  We feel that what you can pay for a 2 bed flat round the corner you can get a 4 bedroom house with a front and back garden - it's a no brainer really! 2. Is a very secure house and I happily walk back alone late at night / stay in the house on my own overnight which can't always be said for other London places I have lived. 3. Love the garden - a saviour in lockdown - is a sun trap and enough space to sunbathe and have a few people over for a BBQ. Overall the property is great for entertaining - indoors and outdoors. Three things we love about the area.1. The community atmosphere on the estate is lovely and we actually know and trust our neighbours with a key.  Given the estate is on the edge of zone one it is surprisingly quiet and tranquil. When we wake up and look out of the bedroom window we see a lot of green which is unusual in such a central location and given we are on a council estate.  2. So many places nearby to exercise outdoors or have a picnic - not just Highbury fields which is a short stroll away, but also Paradise Park (and the lovely free city farm there with a great vegetarian café) and Arundle Square.  There are lots of play areas within a short walking distance - one almost directly outside the front door and for swings and more variety there is Thornhill Square, Arundle Square, and Paradise Park. Can get to Soho in 20 minutes and Kings Cross development in 10.  All the major stations are easy to get to, between Caledonian Rd tube (5 mins walk) and H&I (8 mins walk).  Great choice with the underground lines (Piccadilly and Victoria) as well as the overland trains which can take you all over London. 3. Great local coffee shops and pubs nearby - Southpaw coffee shop is the smallest coffee shop in London and our closest. Q&A1. Why are you selling? We purchased in 2015 for £725k but now need to move closer to family.  This house will be missed.  We have had a wonderful time here. 2. What's the area like? The immediate area is quiet but within moments you can be in the bustling heart of Islington.  Walking distance to Upper Street - great for getting to the many bars and restaurants, screen on the green, and the Almeida. Also - local find - the pleasance comedy theatre near Caledonian Road where you can get headlining acts doing their 'work in progress' for just £5!  Also nearby - Market Road tennis courts and gym which are local authority owned but do great classes.  on a Sunday we head to Hampstead Heath for a coffee and a walk. 3. What is parking like? Can park on the estate (if you buy a pass) or on the street - also need to buy a pass. As a rough estimate my car (an Iago costs about £125 per annum for the street parking - graded though depending on the omissions your car produces). 4. Is there bike storage? Yes for 3 adult bikes at the front of the house, plus room to store all the bike tools and equipment you could need next to it. 5. How busy is the road, is it quiet at night? the estate is pedestrianised and so there is no traffic noise 6. I'm currently working from home, how does that work in this property? It is fantastic.  Have, at times, had 3 adults all working here full time during the pandemic  (in separate rooms) and all successfully managed it.  We are able to pop out and have a choice of lots of nearby coffee shops and cafes to get lunch and within moments can be at Paradise Park for a quick stroll around and fresh air at lunch.  Dry cleaners nearby too.  Always very quiet so can have windows open and be on calls.  In the summer a lot of work is done from the garden. 7. What's the internet like? super band broadband.   I have done multi-day court hearings from home. 8. What's the boiler like? Good - not really sure what to say about this.  The house is very warm as it is well insulated and so the heating bills are modest.  Incredibly cosy house during the winter. 9. Are we able to do any work/extensions? I did the extension in 2012. Could turn the dressing room into a 5th bedroom if you boxed off the door to the bathroom. "

We have really enjoyed the warmth the house offers with its presentation. The greenery and leafiness as well as the privacy of the setting have been especially enjoyed and appreciated during our time here. One feature we really love is the real flame gas powered fire. The walk-through video Hunters Estate Agents have produced for us show the fire blazing, which is great as an added heat source, but we love the cosy atmosphere is creates. The house is within 15 min walking distance (based on our walking pace) of three mainline stations - Crystal Palace, Sydenham Hill, and Sydenham. All these stations offer great connections some of which the Hunters will list in this advert. Whilst Crystal Palace Park is a main attraction in this area, however the lovely and little-known smaller Wells Park is just behind the house (you can see the trees from the balcony) and is one of those little hidden gems. It has two playgrounds, tennis courts, basketball, conservation woodland, two ponds to name but a few attractions. Being surrounded by so much green space despite living in London is a truly lovely experience. With Dulwich being one of the adjoining towns we also spend a lot of time in Dulwich Park, Dulwich Village, and often have dinner in East Dulwich. Dulwich has such a lovely selection of choice be it recreation (art galleries and parks) or dinning in the vast selection of restaurants and pubs in the Village or along Lordship Lane. One of the greatest attractions in South East London (featured in Time Out) is The Horniman Museum and gardens. We often go for family walks there to enjoy the events and farmers market they regularly host. For those buyers who might be seeking great schools there is a vast array of highly rated schools nearby. Dulwich College, Dulwich Prep, Alleyns (mixed), James Allen Girls School (JAGS), St Dunstans, Sydenham High School for girls are all in the locality. Oakfield Prep and Rosemead prep are also close by. We wish the buyer every happiness in the house and hope they enjoy it as much as we have during our time here”Tucked away off Westwood Hill, this private gated development offers only a handful of properties making it rare and exclusive. The house offers over 1430 sq ft of living space split over three floors including an integral garage. Integral garages are great for storage and offer potential to develop / add to the living space (subject to any consents required).

Double doors lead from the rear of the space to the garden and there's an original feature fireplace to the front. Further down the hall you find a kitchen which too has garden access. The bathroom adjoins to the rear of the kitchen. Heading upward you find a long, spacious landing. Three of your bedrooms are healthy doubles and there's a fourth single room facing front. London Bridge services from Queen's Road Station take a mere 10 minutes! In addition, The London Overground Line offers services to Clapham, Canada Water (for the Jubilee Line), Shoreditch and Islington.  This is a well connected location with good bus links into town from the end of the road - the 436 will take you all the way to Paddington and once in Peckham you have the option of the ubiquitous number 12.  The 177 takes you up and down Queen's Road/New Cross Road all the way up to Greenwich/Deptford and the river. As York Grove is closed at one end, it's extremely quiet and certainly one of the most sought after in the immediate area. Peckham Rye and and Telegraph Hill parks are both 15 minutes walk. Edmund Waller and John Donne primary schools (outstanding and good Ofsted ratings) are within range. Shopping and leisure couldn't be easier with Peckham High Street and Camberwell close by. On your doorstep are the acclaimed Peckham Library, the Peckham Pulse Leisure Centre and boho amenities of Bellenden Road with cafés, bars and restaurants plus a good bookshop and boutiques - it's a pleasurable way to spend a Saturday afternoon! Kender Primary is a short stroll for the kids too. Even closer are the cafes and eateries of Queens Road. Kudu promises amazing food and Beer Rebellion has some fantastic craft beers. Other hotspots include Mama Dough, Well & Fed and the newly opened Peckham Cellars for fine wine. For coffee there's Blackbird Bakery and Well&Fed, and for excellent cocktails there's Smokey Kudu which is in the neighbouring railway arch to Blackbird. York Grove is also in the catchment area for the friendly and active ARARA residents association. It's a fab way to meet all your lovely neighbours!"

It has come to our attention that computer hackers are seeking to target property transactions to access funds. As we understand it, they will either hack a phone, tablet, or PC, maybe by sending out a random email that mistakenly gets opened, or even whilst opening a website, which gives them access to that machine. The reason for us mentioning this to you is to alert you that once they have gained access, they can monitor email correspondence, without you knowing, throughout a transaction. Then, at a relevant point, e.g. just before the exchange of contracts, they can send an email to a client mirroring that of their solicitor asking for funds to be transferred to a certain bank account. That money then, of course, disappears. Fortunately, we have not had such an instance but, feel it important to highlight the fact that if you do receive an email requesting funds, it is worth checking with the person concerned by phone that it is genuine and the bank details are correct, before sending money. This could, of course, affect other areas of finance beyond the property. Solicitors are starting to highlight this point now, but for safety, we would urge you to be vigilant and check before sending money or passing on any personal details regarding any bank or credit card information.The Property Misdescriptions Act 1991These particulars are set out as a general outline in accordance with the Property Misdescriptions Act (1991) only for the guidance of intending purchasers or lessees and do not constitute any part of an offer or contract.

31,https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/120589592#/?channel=RES_BUY,"THE STORY OF CEPHAS LINNEY  Cephas Linney hales from the Victorian period and was a notable character in the Heaton Mersey community. He was a coal merchant, removals specialist and well respected philanthropist. His gravestone resides in the Congregational church near to where he once lived.  A local pictorial history book shows the houses that Cephas built with his brother on Mersey Road. They had adjacent semi's and proudly named them Mersey Villas, completed in 1892 as the date stone declares and were the first homes to be built on that side of Mersey Road.  The area has changed and Mersey Road is now an eclectic mix of charming family homes, within the prized Conservation area, that are so sought after. Cephas would be delighted to see his home today where the character still prevails with the sash windows in abundance and the cornices, picture rails and ornamental bosses still in all their glory.  Today the corner plot tells a different story; the old stables have gone, replaced with elegant new homes, but the drive retains the cobbles that once carried Cephas' coal over them. It is also a three storey home these days with an additional en-suite split level bedroom with adjacent dressing area to add to a beautiful first floor bedroom with feature fireplace, another double bedroom with yet another fireplace and generous rear fourth bedroom. Downstairs there is a stunning lounge with another sumptuous cast iron open fireplace, then a superb fitted kitchen with integrated Neff appliances and large island with granite worktops, a dining room, utility room and WC. To complete the picture there are three cellar chambers with good head height with heat, light and power. The corner garden plot has been landscaped with Indian stone split level patio area, pet and child friendly artificial turf, the original cobbled area which can provide off road car parking and a bespoke garden studio in anthracite grey which is fully double glazed and insulated with light and power.  Its versatility means it could  be used as a home office, playroom or as per its current arrangement a delightful gym.Mersey Villas is within walking distance of Priestnall Secondary, St Johns, Didsbury Road and St Winifred's primary schools, Heaton Mersey Common with its 11.5 acres of woodland and the village centre.

The property is situated at the start of Prestwich Park Road South, just off Bury New Road, and is extremely convenient for many amenities:  The village centre with its increasingly eclectic mix of bars, cafes and restaurants together with its many independent and corporate retailers is only a short walk away. The metrolink has its nearest station in the village centre and Manchester City Centre is about 15 minutes away and is easily accessibly by either car, bus or tram. For those needing to travel further afield, the M60/M62/M66 motorway networks are all on the Prestwich/Whitefield border at jct 17 of the M60. There are gardens to both the front and rear of the property, and as the property occupies an elevated position the front garden is tiered from the pavement upto the front door with a paved footpath connecting the two, the garden itself, is well stocked and maintained. To the right hand side of the garden is a detached double garage with a 'remote control operated' sectional rollover door to the front and a separate access door to its rear, which leads to the side of the property. We are informed that the garage benefits from a power, lighting and water supply and also has a mezzanine style floor internally which is ideal for storage. In recent years the property has been substantially upgraded, with most rooms having been replastered, skimmed and redecorated, all three bathrooms and the kitchen have been refurbished and all the external barge boards, soffats, downpipes and gutters have been replaced in plastic. The property is heated by gas central heating and is fully double glazed throughout. As you access the property through the front door the accommodation is as follows: You are straight into the reception hall and to the right hand side, are three doors which give you access to, first of all, the first of the double bedrooms with its fitted furniture to two elevations and patio doors with a juliette balcony overlooking the front garden, the next door leads you into the well equipped utility room, which houses the central heating boiler, is plumbed for a washing machine and vented for a dryer. The last of the three doors takes you into the partially tiled family shower room with its wc and wash hand basin in white and a separate walk in shower enclosure. There is also a built in cloaks cupboard adjacent to the shower room. On the opposite, left hand side of the hallway is the first of two doors, which will take you into a lovely spacious lounge area, with its feature hole in the wall gas fire and its patio doors to the front, the lounge opens into the dining room where you will find another set of patio doors overlooking the front garden. All the rooms at the front of the property have the advantage of large patio doors leading out into the garden. From the dining room there is access through to the spacious kitchen at the rear, which is fitted with grey fascia'd base and wall storage units, complimenting worktops and an inset sink unit there is an integrated 'range' style gas cooker with an extraction unit above which is to be included. To the rear right hand side of the kitchen is a door that returns you back into the lounge. At the rear left hand side of the property is the largest of the bedrooms, and its certainly not the size you would expect, at nearly 7 metres in length, it has a lengthy run of quality furniture to one wall and to the opposite side is its en-suite bathroom, which has fully tiled walls and floor and inset downlights into the ceiling. It boasts a modern four piece suite in white, with a shower over the bath.  The next and final room on this floor is currently used as an office, but dependent on your circumstances would be ideal as either the fourth reception area or fourth bedroom and at over 14 sq meters, could certainly be classed as a double room. Like the majority of the rooms on this floor it also has patio doors, which lead out to the conservatory at the rear, which in turn has a door leading out into the garden. To the rear right hand side of the reception hall is the staircase which now takes you to the next floor, formerley the loft and with all the necessary building regs approval, this is now another substantially sized double bedroom with vellux rooflights to the pitched ceiling, it has an en-suite shower room with a white suite and step in corner shower enclosure and to the far side of the bedroom is an adjoining room which would be ideal as either a dressing room, home office or perhaps even a nursery. Sometimes words and photographs do not give full credit to the property and we feel that this property certainly falls into that category, consequently we would recommend contacting the office and making an early appointment to view as we are confident this property will not be on the market for long."
