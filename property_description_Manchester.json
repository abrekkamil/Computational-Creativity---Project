He was a coal merchant, removals specialist and well respected philanthropist. His gravestone resides in the Congregational church near to where he once lived.  A local pictorial history book shows the houses that Cephas built with his brother on Mersey Road. They had adjacent semi's and proudly named them Mersey Villas, completed in 1892 as the date stone declares and were the first homes to be built on that side of Mersey Road.  The area has changed and Mersey Road is now an eclectic mix of charming family homes, within the prized Conservation area, that are so sought after. Cephas would be delighted to see his home today where the character still prevails with the sash windows in abundance and the cornices, picture rails and ornamental bosses still in all their glory.  Today the corner plot tells a different story; the old stables have gone, replaced with elegant new homes, but the drive retains the cobbles that once carried Cephas' coal over them. It is also a three storey home these days with an additional en-suite split level bedroom with adjacent dressing area to add to a beautiful first floor bedroom with feature fireplace, another double bedroom with yet another fireplace and generous rear fourth bedroom. Downstairs there is a stunning lounge with another sumptuous cast iron open fireplace, then a superb fitted kitchen with integrated Neff appliances and large island with granite worktops, a dining room, utility room and WC. To complete the picture there are three cellar chambers with good head height with heat, light and power. The corner garden plot has been landscaped with Indian stone split level patio area, pet and child friendly artificial turf, the original cobbled area which can provide off road car parking and a bespoke garden studio in anthracite grey which is fully double glazed and insulated with light and power.  Its versatility means it could  be used as a home office, playroom or as per its current arrangement a delightful gym.Mersey Villas is within walking distance of Priestnall Secondary, St Johns, Didsbury Road and St Winifred's primary schools, Heaton Mersey Common with its 11.5 acres of woodland and the village centre.

The property is situated at the start of Prestwich Park Road South, just off Bury New Road, and is extremely convenient for many amenities:  The village centre with its increasingly eclectic mix of bars, cafes and restaurants together with its many independent and corporate retailers is only a short walk away. The metrolink has its nearest station in the village centre and Manchester City Centre is about 15 minutes away and is easily accessibly by either car, bus or tram. For those needing to travel further afield, the M60/M62/M66 motorway networks are all on the Prestwich/Whitefield border at jct 17 of the M60. There are gardens to both the front and rear of the property, and as the property occupies an elevated position the front garden is tiered from the pavement upto the front door with a paved footpath connecting the two, the garden itself, is well stocked and maintained. To the right hand side of the garden is a detached double garage with a 'remote control operated' sectional rollover door to the front and a separate access door to its rear, which leads to the side of the property. We are informed that the garage benefits from a power, lighting and water supply and also has a mezzanine style floor internally which is ideal for storage. In recent years the property has been substantially upgraded, with most rooms having been replastered, skimmed and redecorated, all three bathrooms and the kitchen have been refurbished and all the external barge boards, soffats, downpipes and gutters have been replaced in plastic. The property is heated by gas central heating and is fully double glazed throughout. As you access the property through the front door the accommodation is as follows: You are straight into the reception hall and to the right hand side, are three doors which give you access to, first of all, the first of the double bedrooms with its fitted furniture to two elevations and patio doors with a juliette balcony overlooking the front garden, the next door leads you into the well equipped utility room, which houses the central heating boiler, is plumbed for a washing machine and vented for a dryer. The last of the three doors takes you into the partially tiled family shower room with its wc and wash hand basin in white and a separate walk in shower enclosure. There is also a built in cloaks cupboard adjacent to the shower room. On the opposite, left hand side of the hallway is the first of two doors, which will take you into a lovely spacious lounge area, with its feature hole in the wall gas fire and its patio doors to the front, the lounge opens into the dining room where you will find another set of patio doors overlooking the front garden. All the rooms at the front of the property have the advantage of large patio doors leading out into the garden. From the dining room there is access through to the spacious kitchen at the rear, which is fitted with grey fascia'd base and wall storage units, complimenting worktops and an inset sink unit there is an integrated 'range' style gas cooker with an extraction unit above which is to be included. To the rear right hand side of the kitchen is a door that returns you back into the lounge. At the rear left hand side of the property is the largest of the bedrooms, and its certainly not the size you would expect, at nearly 7 metres in length, it has a lengthy run of quality furniture to one wall and to the opposite side is its en-suite bathroom, which has fully tiled walls and floor and inset downlights into the ceiling. It boasts a modern four piece suite in white, with a shower over the bath.  The next and final room on this floor is currently used as an office, but dependent on your circumstances would be ideal as either the fourth reception area or fourth bedroom and at over 14 sq meters, could certainly be classed as a double room. Like the majority of the rooms on this floor it also has patio doors, which lead out to the conservatory at the rear, which in turn has a door leading out into the garden. To the rear right hand side of the reception hall is the staircase which now takes you to the next floor, formerley the loft and with all the necessary building regs approval, this is now another substantially sized double bedroom with vellux rooflights to the pitched ceiling, it has an en-suite shower room with a white suite and step in corner shower enclosure and to the far side of the bedroom is an adjoining room which would be ideal as either a dressing room, home office or perhaps even a nursery. Sometimes words and photographs do not give full credit to the property and we feel that this property certainly falls into that category, consequently we would recommend contacting the office and making an early appointment to view as we are confident this property will not be on the market for long."}, {"id": 86, "url": "https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/122430122#/?channel=RES_BUY", "Property description": "An EXCEPTIONALLY PRESENTED semi detached, which has been COMPREHENSIVELY UPDATED and REMODELLED, creating a WONDERFUL FAMILY HOME, located close to both DIDSBURY and WEST DIDSBURY villages. 1237 sq ft.

As you enter this home you are welcome into a wide hall which leads to the reception room & kitchen or straight upstairs. The two reception rooms are equally good sizes both of which allowing for plenty of light. The front reception room, used as a sitting area  has a bay window & a chimney breast which is the centrepiece of the room. The back reception room is more of a traditional dining area with a large window overlooking the garden. Both reception rooms and hallway have karndean flooring installed in the past couple of years giving a lovely finish to them both. The kitchen is an excellent size and will be sold with all fixtures and fittings should the buyer be interested. The items are relatively new so will be perfect for a first-time buyer. The garden is southwest facing and currently attracts some very colourful and pretty birds for you to have a nosey at. Upstairs are two double bedrooms, a large single bedroom, and a bathroom. The smaller of the three bedrooms is currently used as a home offer but could easily accommodate a single bed and free-standing furniture. The smaller of the two double bedrooms benefit from the chimney breast being removed so you have much more space for a bed or beds of your choosing and storage. The larger of the three bedrooms is located at the front of the property and is the width of the entire house.  Again, this is perfect of any bed of your choosing along with any wardrobes you wish to have. Overall, the property is in great condition and is perfect for a residential purchase.
