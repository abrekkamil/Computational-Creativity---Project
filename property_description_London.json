The homes are the result of five years of design development and are being built around three main pillars: to be carbon negative, with zero construction waste and net energy positive and so set to incur no utility bills. The homes are fully electric, powered solely by solar panels and are all EPC A rated. The majority of the features in the homes have been designed bespoke for The Arbour and include compressed earth brick walls and lampshades made from site soil, worktops made from wood shavings from the timber frame, shower panels from recycled plastics and more.IF YOU LIVED HERE The interior design is by Rockett St George, who have carefully curated each space and fixture to align with the aspirations of the project, which debuts their new sustainable furniture range. Materials have been selected portray a contemporary design, to be low carbon and require little maintenance. The Arbour benefits from an abundance of communal landscaped spaces, including a central community garden that will include vegetable patches, foraging, outdoor kitchen and seating. The gardens have been landscaped by the award-winning London Glades, to be self-sustainable over time and to provide a safe and enjoyable space for families to come together. The development also includes a re-use centre, an electric car club vehicle and electric and traditional bicycles all exclusively reserved for residents. WHAT ELSE?- Walthamstow schools are excellent and plentiful, within a one mile radius alone you have twenty eight primary/secondary schools, all rated 'Good' or better by Ofsted with eight deemed 'Outstanding'.- Your spoilt for choice when it comes to great pubs. The Queen's Arms is the closest, offering excellent food and a great choice of craft beers in a comfortable , traditionally sumptuous environment. - Amongst many other local highlights, Europe's longest street market runs down Walthamstow High Street, less than a half mile stroll away as well as Epping Forest and the Walthamstow Wetlands.While the perks of Walthamstow Village are a mere stone’s throw away, you’ll have your own community on your literal doorstep;....... Residents can ‘live, work and play’ within the space, with access to a covered community garden with an outdoor workstation and kitchen for preparing homegrown food, as well as a reuse centre for exchanging goods between residents.'For me, this development is watershed moment in British construction. The building techniques used have been groundbreaking and once I delved into the details, I was left inspired by the materials used and conscious of how our consumer choices can make a difference.  The project has been carefully curated over 5 years and studies embarked on by GS8 have unearthed issues associated with standard building techniques. With innovative ideas the GS8 team have set about to find solutions to assist this project and help move the industry forward, which in turn will benefit future generations. Purchasers have a rare chance to own a home that in years to come will be recognised as a masterpiece in construction, which challenges not only the way we build but also the way with live.'

The owners have run a successful business here since the 1970s, having always loved the village location. So when they decided to modernise they engaged specialist architects to design and extend the space to a contemporary finish, while preserving  the building’s historic character and attributes. And the result is gorgeous.It’s set over 2 floors, with a reception area at the front, open-plan desk space, storage space, kitchen area, 2 WCs with disabled access & shower room, and a new staircase leading up to meeting rooms.The pitched roof & exposed ceiling joists not only look incredible, they maximise the sense of space; and a glass divide over the party wall provides sound proofing, without compromising the flow of natural light. People love working here because of its homely atmosphere & village location. And the refurb reflects what people want in offices now. The state of the art ventilation system physically changes the air & a fully equipped kitchen gives people the means to make a good meal at lunchtime, with a comfortable space to sit or step outside.Located in the heart of the village, & a short walk from local cafes, restaurants and sports facilities, there’s easy access to transport links by bus, by tube and Overground from Walthamstow Central station, which is a 10 minute walk away or a 4 minute cycle.

The house was fully renovated in 2017; it's been sensitively and artfully-extended both out and up, and boasts both bath and shower rooms. Paint and professional colour consulting impresses throughout (March & Son of Lewes, Sussex), and a well-established rear garden extends over 25 feet (accessed from large folding doors from your dining area).   You're really close to Peckham Rye Park and Common's 113 acres, the beautiful green space of Nunhead cemetery, and also to volunteer-run Aquarius Golf Club. Your local stations are Nunhead, Peckham Rye and Brockley; all are circa a mile from the house (and Fare Zone 2).  From the hall, your formal through-reception rests to your left. Beautifully-laid oak herringbone flooring runs through here - reclaimed from a school in north Wales. Further treats include cast iron radiators, a gas-fuelled stove in woodburner style, and an original fireplace reinstated (not functional); both with slate hearths. The large kitchen/dining room - of over 18 feet by over 11 feet - is accessed from part-glazed timber double-doors (yet another lovely feature). What a room! Marrying old and new harmoniously, you've got a large roof light over the dining area, and a dreamy fitted kitchen from British Standard by Plain English, teamed with Carrera marble and reclaimed Iroko hardwood worktops. Other welcome features include a fitted larder, a boiler cupboard, storage, laundry space for washer/dryer, and a polished concrete floor (with clever water underfloor heating system). At the foot of the delightful room, you have a full-span, narrow-frame sliding glazing system, which fully opens for inside-out dining in the summer months.  Up to the first floor and from the half-landing, you'll find the main bathroom (which was renovated in 2019) to the rear of the house, with sash window, neat and modern white suite, and large built-in cupboard - which is great for towels and such.  From the main landing, find a large and twin-sashed master bedroom across the front of the house (this is over 12 feet by over 11 feet), and your second bedroom's next door (of over 11 feet by over 7 feet). Both rooms have original feature fireplaces, and wool carpets were laid in 2020 (sanded and treated floorboards with 'white wash' are beneath the carpets - if that's more your thing). At the top of the house is a very lovely large loft bedroom, of over 19 feet by over 12 feet. You have Velux and casement windows, and custom-built wardrobes plus accessible eaves storage. A neat and windowed en suite with large walk-in shower completes the house tour.  Green space? Peckham Rye Park & Common is your most local green space (walk five minutes) - comprising a Victorian Park and historic common; a pleasant refuge for both the local community and wildlife. It's home to ornamental gardens, streams, woodland and a lake, playgrounds and a cafe, plus outdoor gym. The park has been awarded Green Flag status and has a long, rich and engaging history - it was recorded as being cultivated before the Norman Conquest in the 11th Century! At the tip of the common you have a host of cool eateries like Mr Bao, Good Neighbour and Banh Banh, and trendy hairdressing salon (Blue Tit).  Bellenden Road, Blenheim Grove and Rye Lane are also close for yummy restaurants (we love Levan, Ganapati, The Begging Bowl and Artusi), cool bars and pubs, Peckham Levels, and The Bussey Building.  You're a short stroll from Nunhead and East Dulwich's town centres too. In Nunhead we like Kudu Grill and El Vermut, plus Ayres bakery and FC Soper wet fish shop. Brockley's also close for more options, and for pubs - The Ivy House, The Waverley, The Herne and The Angel Oak are all strong locals.

Must see property."}, {"id": 186, "url": "https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/121504370#/?channel=RES_BUY", "Property description": "The AreaForest Gate has a history of offering a mosaic of woodland and grazing (it's in the name!), forming part of Wanstead Flats and wider Epping Forest. Not many know about this hidden green oasis in the far reaches of the East End. This one-of-a-kind home was recently completed on a plot in the heart of Forest Gate. Finding a plot of land of this size and potential in London is becoming an increasing rarity, but for Mr C who designed and developed the property, it was an opportunity not to miss. The site was just a post-war gap between houses, left to the elements for too long.  Planning was achieved for a 3-bedroom house on the site, with a split lower and upper-level layout, creating almost a hidden home in residential Newham.Architecture and property'The internal face of the house is all clad in waterproofed cork sheets, perfect for retaining heat and acoustics. It also has a subtle wood bark smell, which defined our relationship with the house', Mr C explains as he walks me through the process of build & eventual design. The soil was of solid clay ground when preparing the site, thus foundation works were smooth, great for the lower floor's concrete 'basin'.  Pink-hued facing bricks are used for the exterior, alongside low-carbon blockwork to form cavity walls, where exposed Douglas Fir roof joists sit on and form the flat green roofs. Mr C explains how they had to use a 'contrasting' material for the taller volume of the roof, so went for corrugated metal sheets to clad the upper level of the house. The house is surrounded by gardens on all sides, which ensures that all the courtyards are visually and physically connected. Skylights are consciously positioned throughout for daylight to stream into the house. Natural materials are used throughout to give a harmony to the aesthetic, with cork sheets lining the cavity walls, treated plywood panels used to line the ceiling and breathable lime render on all internal partitions. The floor is finished with poured resin over underfloor heating; a wonderful treat for barefoot living. Brass kitchen cabinetry is used to bring drama and to reflect light in the centre of the house, a bold statement for a home with otherwise organic finishes. BackgroundMr C talked to me about how he wanted to build beautiful sustainability into the house, which is why they opted for cork sheets.  This sustainable awareness is echoed in the low-carbon blockwork and lime render. The house achieves a blend of being visually attractive whilst retaining the all-important sustainability creds. The level of thoughtfulness brought to the materials throughout the house also delivers cheaper energy bills!As an architect, Mr C has always wanted to build his own house and came across the plot online by chance. Having been living in North London, with no prior connection to Forest Gate, he and his partner suddenly realised what could be achieved, in this exciting location.  In order to achieve planning requirements, the house could not be too tall, so they opted for a half-sunken lower-ground floor level for the principal bedroom and ensuite bathroom. This resulted in a shorter flight of stairs with no landing to reduce the flow around levels, consequently opening up an additional room in the stairwell itself. The windows in the central courtyard also connect the level visually from room to room.As the internal face of the house is cork clad, this keeps heat in and provides additional natural insulation and a textured approach, creating an almost cocoon-like feel to the house.Out and AboutAs this is a genuine East End residential area, it has an obvious energy for regeneration given its proximity to the Elizabeth Line. This area has become increasingly popular with young families, benefitting from a great school network and rapid access to City, Stansted and Luton airports. Close by are Forest Gate Arches, recently regenerated to include an array of great local businesses. Some choice pickings include, Wild Goose Bakery, an artisan bakery, an authentic Italian delicatessen and Pretty Decent Beer Company, an independent brewery just at the end of the road!  The Holly Tree pub just around the corner has been refurbished and is perfect for a Sunday roast.Hackney Wick and Stratford are close by as well, with a vast array of pubs, bars and restaurants, and the Westfield shopping centre is a short drive. A real asset is the proximity to the huge natural areas of Wanstead Flats, and the close proximity to Epping Forest. \"Whenever we want to take a break from working at home, we go for a walk in the Flats trying out different paths. It is massive, full of ponds and lakes teeming with nature. Wellies are a must though \" said Mr C. Transport LinksForest Gate overground is a 9 minute walk, connecting straight through to Liverpool Street for the City, and linking up with Stratford for the Central Line. Wanstead Park overground is also a 7 minute stroll, linking West to East, and is only two stops to Barking for the district line. An array of 24-hour buses from Forest Road take you straight into Stratford Westfield and the Olympic in under 30 minutes."}, {"id": 187, "url": "https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/120463136#/?channel=RES_BUY", "Property description": "A three double bedroom, three bathroom family home.

Just a 10 minute walk to the Village, with close access to both the Hoe St and St James St areas it's right in the middle of things.  It also only takes 8 minutes to walk the tube, which provides a fantastic balance of life in London.  We enjoy just being in the house: both the bright, open, spacious feeling of the extension and the snuggly hygge vibes in the living room and bedrooms.  Then also the garden with barbecues on the patio, lying out on the grass and gardening, eating, reading or doing yoga out on the decking.  We've also been blessed with a friendly neighbourhood, which has a real community spirit.  We love walking up to the Village with great food at Eat 17, getting the best fish n chips on Orford Rd, and all the other options for eating out; then up to God’s Own Junkyard and all the breweries for a night out, and so many great pizza places with Yard Sale, So Do (Hoe St), and The Italian Bakery (St James St).  Due to the many transport links the whole of London feels at your fingertips.  We regularly swim at Parliament Hill Lido and walk on Hampstead Heath and door to door it only takes 25 minutes from Walthamstow Queens Rd (a huge bonus because of our position in the area).  We enjoy running up to and around Hollow Ponds, the mysterious park where Alfred Hitchcock grew up and also Wanstead Park with it’s lake and grotto, only 10 minutes drive away.\"Dimensions: - Entrance - Via front door leading into:Entrance Hallway - Staircase leading to first floor.

Even closer to home are the Heathcote and Star, Solway Society, Gravity Well and an okonomiyaki with a great glass of wine or a craft beer at the Fillybrook. Both the Central line and the Overground are close by for easy access into the centre. Sometimes we'll walk a bit further and buy a fantastic steak from the Ginger Pig and some amazing fruit and veg from Harveys up in Wanstead. It's a great place to run; as well as Hollow Ponds, you can easily run through the Olympic Park and along the canal to Victoria Park. In Leytonstone itself we'll probably miss the excellent dim sum at Panda and the great Sardinian food at Mora the most of all.\""}, {"id": 250, "url": "https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/119728949#/?channel=RES_BUY", "Property description": "  A charming three bedroom Victorian house, retaining much of its original charm with fireplaces to most rooms and floorboards throughout.

The large rear garden is well screened by mature trees, being utilised by both parts of the property. There is space to park 2 cars to the front with the potential to create more parking subject to the usual consents being obtained.

We fell in love with it the minute we viewed, with the size of the rooms, high ceilings and general character. Its versatility has worked so well over the years, enabling family and friends to stay over within their own space. We love that the garden offers all day sunshine, seclusion and an array of wildlife. It's a lovely area to live in with a great community spirit.

A couple of welcome storage cupboards (one a large boiler room; the other a slim cupboard) are found on the half-landing outside the bathroom.  From the landing proper, you have your first double bedroom, of over 10 feet by over 9 feet, with a cute original feature fireplace.  Finally, find the master bedroom to the front of the house. Twin sash windows provide leafy park vistas over Lucas Gardens. What a treat in Zone 2! Generous built-in closets, another fireplace and alcove storage tick more boxes.  St. Giles Church and Churchyard are utterly lovely local landmarks, and you're also close to South London Gallery, plus Camberwell's iconic art college buildings. It's a very nice part of town. Beyond Lucas Gardens, you've got lots of other green spaces around and about - Brunswick, Ruskin and Burgess Parks for example, and Lettsom and Warwick Gardens too. Peckham Rye Park and Common and Brockwell Park and Lido aren't far either.  Local schools include Lyndhurst Primary and The Villa Nursery and Pre-Prep. School.  Restaurants, cafes, pubs and bars are strong and varied round this way. We particularly like The Camberwell Arms (more than a pub - the restaurant offering is delicious), Grove House Tavern, The Crooked Well, Silk Road and Theo's. Walk to Peckham's Bellenden Road and Rye Lane for other excellent offerings - including Artusi, Ganapati, Levan, Peckham Levels and The Bussey Building, plus handy high street shops, pop-ups and markets.  Butterfly Tennis Club and Zen Yoga studio are also nearby, on Camberwell Grove, as well as the Victorian leisure centre with big pool, gym and classes. You are close to two Fare Zone 2 stations as previously mentioned, and also to a host of day and night bus routes at the foot of the street, from Camberwell Church Street.

Access the garden via a back door here (extension potential alert), onto a paved area - ideal for al fresco meals - which leads to a generous lawn.

This is so much more than just another new housing scheme. Every aspect of the design and architecture has been a collaboration between designer Matthias Felsch and sculptor Jeff Lowe. It represents their belief that new homes absolutely can combine style, functionality, and individuality. Jeff was keen to ensure that the houses all had dedicated creative spaces, while Matthias saw to it that, whilst there is an extraordinary amount of floor space on offer, each one is a practical home as well. Number 3 is one of three town houses and is slightly larger at 150 square metres. As with number 2, accommodation is arranged over three spacious levels but the twist lies in its outdoor space. Rather than a top floor terrace, this house has a walled rear garden which becomes an extension of the large living area once those oversized bi-fold doors are thrown open.On the first floor you will find two double bedrooms and two bathrooms; the minimal, clean lines balance well with the natural tones Matthias has used. Spanning the top floor is a cavernous studio with high, beamed ceilings whose cool limed finish create a gently industrial feel. As will the other houses in the mews, this space lends itself to all sorts of activities: a gym, further reception space, vast bedroom or a studio/office that would hold a serious-sized business.The focus of the design is very much the consolidation of home and work. the integral tech is thoroughly up to date, with Cat 6 cabling and local fibre broadband should you want it, while clever internal lighting options give total control over your environment.This quiet corner of South East London is something of a hidden gem. It is a desirable residential location but with Hither Green Station more or less on the door step, it is a gateway to London and beyond. Trains to London Bridge, Charing Cross or Cannon Street are frequent and take around ten minutes. There is also the option for a change at New Cross for the Overground to Shoreditch and North London or head to Lewisham and grab the DLR for Canary Wharf, Stratford, or The City.Lewisham's constantly evolving town centre is close by. You can take a train or bus there, but it is an easy walk.

Your local stations are Nunhead, Peckham Rye and Brockley; all are circa a mile from the house (and Fare Zone 2).  Open directly into the open-plan reception room - with the stairs dividing living and dining areas. It's a generous space at over 24 feet by over 12 feet, and welcome and characterful features include a wood-burning stove and stripped original boards to the floor.  The kitchen lies beyond: a timeless Shaker-style one, with wooden worktops, and double-glazed French doors out to the low-maintenance garden.  Up the stairs and you've got the property's bathroom to the rear - with a tiled floor, sash window, neat white sanitary ware, and an over bath shower. Next door is a double bedroom with sash window to garden views, and the second (twin-sashed) double bedroom takes the width of the terrace (over 13 feet), to the front of the house, with a feature fireplace. Both bedrooms have stripped floors and white walls.  Up to the second floor and you've got an impressive large third bedroom - an obvious master - of over 18 feet by over 11 feet. Wooden floors, skylight windows, a Juliet balcony and accessible eaves storage tick even more boxes.  Green space?

The park has been awarded Green Flag status and has a long, rich and engaging history - it was recorded as being cultivated before the Norman Conquest in the 11th Century! At the tip of the common you have a host of cool eateries and such - including Mr Bao, Good Neighbour and Banh Banh, and trendy hairdressing salon (Blue Tit).  Bellenden Road, Blenheim Grove and Rye Lane are also close for yummy restaurants (we love Levan, Ganapati, The Begging Bowl and Artusi), cool bars and pubs, Peckham Levels, and The Bussey Building.

They combine to create a near-perfect, modern family home. Sumptuous and draped in colour, the ground floor is a dream to entertain in. The cosy and atmospheric bay-fronted living room connects with the luminous light-filled kitchen/diner extension with doors opening onto the garden oasis, complete with its own wood cabin. The considered design means each 'zone' feels self-contained yet provides a lovely, inter-connected flow.  Upstairs, the thoughtful layout continues. There are two large double bedrooms, an exquisitely designed bathroom with a soaking tub on the first floor, and a further two bedrooms, one en-suite, in the loft extension. Currently set up as a dressing room, the fourth bedroom would work equally well as a dedicated home office. Perched on the outskirts of the city, Bounds Green profits from lush parkland in all directions, a vibrant neighbourhood and excellent transport connections, whisking you to Central London in around 20 minutes. For all these reasons and more, it's easy to understand why this pocket of London is such a draw for families, young and old.The Owners Say - We adore this beautiful home that we have so lovingly created and will absolutely miss everything the area has to offer. We are incredibly lucky to be a short walk away from both underground (Piccadilly Line) and overground (Great Northern Rail). We have an abundance of green spaces close by and are in the catchment for an outstanding primary school which is quite literally at the end of the road. Our local pub, The Ranelagh, is excellent, as are the local friendly coffee shops such as White Fig and dog-friendly Hot Milk. The Organic store near Bounds Green Tube is very well stocked, and the rather splendid Myddleton Road market is where you can pick up everything from Artisan bakes to vintage finds. We're incredibly lucky to have wonderful neighbours all along the street. From coffee mornings to festive drinks, the Stanley Road community spirit runs deep. We have had some wonderful, memorable, happy years living here and shall greatly miss it.Points To Consider - The EPC gives a current Energy Efficiency Rating: C and a potential Energy Efficiency Rating: BIn the Borough of Enfield, the house falls into Council Tax Band D (£1,841.71 in 2022).The current owners have entirely updated the house. Large ticket items include a loft extension, creating two new bedrooms, and an ensuite- bathroom. The new principal bedroom on the top floor has many thoughtful touches, including rimless plastered-in recessed spotlights and 'hidden' storage. Downstairs, they built an open plan kitchen/diner extension with polished concrete floors and underfloor heating, plus a new WC and utility room. All the bathrooms have underfloor heating. Furthermore, they have replaced the boiler and added new windows throughout, including Velux windows in the loft bedroom.

The overall space available in the property.  We feel that what you can pay for a 2 bed flat round the corner you can get a 4 bedroom house with a front and back garden - it's a no brainer really! 2. Is a very secure house and I happily walk back alone late at night / stay in the house on my own overnight which can't always be said for other London places I have lived. 3. Love the garden - a saviour in lockdown - is a sun trap and enough space to sunbathe and have a few people over for a BBQ. Overall the property is great for entertaining - indoors and outdoors. Three things we love about the area.1. The community atmosphere on the estate is lovely and we actually know and trust our neighbours with a key.  Given the estate is on the edge of zone one it is surprisingly quiet and tranquil. When we wake up and look out of the bedroom window we see a lot of green which is unusual in such a central location and given we are on a council estate.  2. So many places nearby to exercise outdoors or have a picnic - not just Highbury fields which is a short stroll away, but also Paradise Park (and the lovely free city farm there with a great vegetarian café) and Arundle Square.  There are lots of play areas within a short walking distance - one almost directly outside the front door and for swings and more variety there is Thornhill Square, Arundle Square, and Paradise Park. Can get to Soho in 20 minutes and Kings Cross development in 10.  All the major stations are easy to get to, between Caledonian Rd tube (5 mins walk) and H&I (8 mins walk).  Great choice with the underground lines (Piccadilly and Victoria) as well as the overland trains which can take you all over London. 3. Great local coffee shops and pubs nearby - Southpaw coffee shop is the smallest coffee shop in London and our closest. Q&A1. Why are you selling? We purchased in 2015 for £725k but now need to move closer to family.  This house will be missed.  We have had a wonderful time here. 2. What's the area like? The immediate area is quiet but within moments you can be in the bustling heart of Islington.  Walking distance to Upper Street - great for getting to the many bars and restaurants, screen on the green, and the Almeida. Also - local find - the pleasance comedy theatre near Caledonian Road where you can get headlining acts doing their 'work in progress' for just £5!  Also nearby - Market Road tennis courts and gym which are local authority owned but do great classes.  on a Sunday we head to Hampstead Heath for a coffee and a walk. 3. What is parking like? Can park on the estate (if you buy a pass) or on the street - also need to buy a pass. As a rough estimate my car (an Iago costs about £125 per annum for the street parking - graded though depending on the omissions your car produces). 4. Is there bike storage? Yes for 3 adult bikes at the front of the house, plus room to store all the bike tools and equipment you could need next to it. 5. How busy is the road, is it quiet at night? the estate is pedestrianised and so there is no traffic noise 6. I'm currently working from home, how does that work in this property? It is fantastic.  Have, at times, had 3 adults all working here full time during the pandemic  (in separate rooms) and all successfully managed it.  We are able to pop out and have a choice of lots of nearby coffee shops and cafes to get lunch and within moments can be at Paradise Park for a quick stroll around and fresh air at lunch.  Dry cleaners nearby too.  Always very quiet so can have windows open and be on calls.  In the summer a lot of work is done from the garden. 7. What's the internet like? super band broadband.   I have done multi-day court hearings from home. 8. What's the boiler like? Good - not really sure what to say about this.  The house is very warm as it is well insulated and so the heating bills are modest.  Incredibly cosy house during the winter. 9. Are we able to do any work/extensions? I did the extension in 2012. Could turn the dressing room into a 5th bedroom if you boxed off the door to the bathroom. "}, {"id": 905, "url": "https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/121653185#/?channel=RES_BUY", "Property description": "A fantastic two bedroom house on White Hart Lane, moments from the independent shops and eateries that this area has to offer.

We have really enjoyed the warmth the house offers with its presentation. The greenery and leafiness as well as the privacy of the setting have been especially enjoyed and appreciated during our time here. One feature we really love is the real flame gas powered fire. The walk-through video Hunters Estate Agents have produced for us show the fire blazing, which is great as an added heat source, but we love the cosy atmosphere is creates. The house is within 15 min walking distance (based on our walking pace) of three mainline stations - Crystal Palace, Sydenham Hill, and Sydenham. All these stations offer great connections some of which the Hunters will list in this advert. Whilst Crystal Palace Park is a main attraction in this area, however the lovely and little-known smaller Wells Park is just behind the house (you can see the trees from the balcony) and is one of those little hidden gems. It has two playgrounds, tennis courts, basketball, conservation woodland, two ponds to name but a few attractions. Being surrounded by so much green space despite living in London is a truly lovely experience. With Dulwich being one of the adjoining towns we also spend a lot of time in Dulwich Park, Dulwich Village, and often have dinner in East Dulwich. Dulwich has such a lovely selection of choice be it recreation (art galleries and parks) or dinning in the vast selection of restaurants and pubs in the Village or along Lordship Lane. One of the greatest attractions in South East London (featured in Time Out) is The Horniman Museum and gardens. We often go for family walks there to enjoy the events and farmers market they regularly host. For those buyers who might be seeking great schools there is a vast array of highly rated schools nearby. Dulwich College, Dulwich Prep, Alleyns (mixed), James Allen Girls School (JAGS), St Dunstans, Sydenham High School for girls are all in the locality. Oakfield Prep and Rosemead prep are also close by. We wish the buyer every happiness in the house and hope they enjoy it as much as we have during our time here”Tucked away off Westwood Hill, this private gated development offers only a handful of properties making it rare and exclusive. The house offers over 1430 sq ft of living space split over three floors including an integral garage.

The house offers some of the following:•\tOff street parking,•\tA private garden •\tA balcony•\tThree W/C’s•\tA lounge diner spanning the depth of the house which is some 28ft approximately•\tTwo showers and a bath•\tFlexible accommodation which could be used as a 5 bedroom house Please view our 360 DEGREE VIRTUAL TOUR and HD VIDEO WALK THROUGH as these offer buyers much better insight and provide a realistic view of the property. The property is in proximity of several local schools which are highly rated by OFSTED. In our experience, it’s unusual to find a property that is located to this many highly rated schools. These schools include the highly acclaimed Dulwich College, Alleyns, James Allen Girls School, St Dunstan's College - Church of England, mixed, primary and secondary to name but a few. Crystal Palace, Dulwich, Forest Hill and Sydenham towns offer many small independent high street conveniences including an award-winning butcher, some fantastic cafes, several boutique shops selling clothing and furniture as well as a few great modern gastro and family friendly pubs.Locally you will find both well-established brand-named stores and eateries such as Megan’s, Pizza Express, Gails Bakery, Nando’s Boots, Superdrug, Tesco, Lidl, Blackbird Bakery as well as many smaller independent businesses such as Trattoria Raffaele - a popular and long-standing Italian restaurant in the area.

It has come to our attention that computer hackers are seeking to target property transactions to access funds. As we understand it, they will either hack a phone, tablet, or PC, maybe by sending out a random email that mistakenly gets opened, or even whilst opening a website, which gives them access to that machine. The reason for us mentioning this to you is to alert you that once they have gained access, they can monitor email correspondence, without you knowing, throughout a transaction. Then, at a relevant point, e.g. just before the exchange of contracts, they can send an email to a client mirroring that of their solicitor asking for funds to be transferred to a certain bank account. That money then, of course, disappears. Fortunately, we have not had such an instance but, feel it important to highlight the fact that if you do receive an email requesting funds, it is worth checking with the person concerned by phone that it is genuine and the bank details are correct, before sending money. This could, of course, affect other areas of finance beyond the property. Solicitors are starting to highlight this point now, but for safety, we would urge you to be vigilant and check before sending money or passing on any personal details regarding any bank or credit card information.The Property Misdescriptions Act 1991These particulars are set out as a general outline in accordance with the Property Misdescriptions Act (1991) only for the guidance of intending purchasers or lessees and do not constitute any part of an offer or contract.
